# Analysis Status Report

## Current Situation

We've encountered API rate limits that are more restrictive than initially expected:
- **Actual limit**: 80,000 output tokens per minute
- **Effective rate**: ~1-2 successful reviews per second with rate limiting

## Progress So Far

### Successfully Analyzed
- **Test batches**: 150 reviews (100% success)
- **From checkpoint**: 1,455 reviews (29.1% of 5,000 attempted)
- **Total analyzed**: ~1,605 reviews

### Rate Limit Issues
- 3,544 reviews failed with 429 rate limit errors
- Current approach is too aggressive for the API limits

## Cost Analysis

Based on the successful analyses:
- Average output tokens per review: ~85 tokens
- Cost per review: ~$0.0001 (very cost-effective)
- Total cost for 16,764 reviews: ~$1.68

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Continue with Ultra-Conservative Settings
- Use `retry_failed_reviews.py` with:
  - 2 concurrent requests
  - 0.5-1 second delay between requests
  - 60 requests per minute max
- Estimated time: ~4-5 hours for remaining reviews
- Very reliable but slow

### Option 2: Use a Different Approach
- Process in smaller daily batches (e.g., 2,000 reviews/day)
- Spread the load over a week
- Avoids rate limit issues

### Option 3: Upgrade API Limits
- Contact Anthropic sales to increase rate limits
- Would allow faster processing

### Option 4: Use Current Data
- We already have 12,785 analyzed reviews
- The 1,605 newly analyzed reviews improve coverage slightly
- Current data may be sufficient for insights

## Current Data Coverage

With existing analyzed data:
- **Rogers**: 9,038 reviews (62.3% coverage)
- **Bell**: 3,747 reviews (25.1% coverage)

Adding the 1,605 new reviews (all Rogers):
- **Rogers**: 10,643 reviews (73.3% coverage)
- **Bell**: 3,747 reviews (25.1% coverage)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Save and consolidate the 1,455 successfully analyzed reviews
2. **Short-term**: Decide on approach for remaining ~15,000 reviews
3. **Consider**: Whether current coverage is sufficient for business insights

The dashboard already provides valuable insights with the current data. The additional reviews would improve accuracy but may not fundamentally change the findings.
