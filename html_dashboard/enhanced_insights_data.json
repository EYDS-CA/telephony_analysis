I was informed by Tech support (after almost 3 weeks of not having my data usage availability issue solved) that to get my data usage, i have to use the website account which is definitely a step backwards regarding convenience. This is contrary to what i was informed when switched from the previous app for which i had no issues accessing my data usage. If that's the case then why was the previous app discontinued since i could access the data usage through that. If this app does not fully support small business users then that should clearly be stated. The phone and plan tabs populate correctly, but the usage tab says i have made a plan change (which i have never made) and so usage details are unavailable.",
