1,Negative,"Honestly, worse app and company so far; Using Roger's 1.5gb internet service and guess what? I'm not getting 1.5gb. Getting 15-20mb btwn 9 - 11pm even after resetting router. Tired of this. Used the app to get solution and when tried using Anna for help chat couldn't work. So what's the point? Why am I paying for Roger's?

1,Negative,"Total incompetent thieves. Tried to add a line to my acct. They messed up the Sim chip delivery via also incompetent Purolator no-brians. I havent even received the chip yet, but they billed me an entire month of service / fees... without providing any actual service, or the Sim. They refuse to refund the months fee, or have a manager answer the phone. Strongly suggest a different cell provider. Need to terminate several wanna-be 'managers'.","The customer had a very negative experience trying to add a new line to their account, with issues related to the SIM card delivery and being billed for a month of service without receiving any actual service.",2024-07-03 12:30:32
1,Negative,pretty useless this app if you have to delete and re download everytime you want to make a simple change on your account. Ask Anna is also pretty useless.

1,Negative,"I am more than disappointed in your Accounts Receivable System. I am sick of your robot ""Anna"" telling me that I am late on the 2nd and you ""human"" persons telling me my payment due date is on the 8th and to include my late fees??? This last time I paid in full on the 5th at the Bank of NS in Chilliwack and confirmed with your good person in N B(who actually confirmed my due date is the 8th and ""thanked me for my 5th pmt and there is no overdue charges"" I just received demand""no email tranfer""?","Customer is frustrated with inconsistencies in Rogers' payment system and due dates.

Despite making a payment on the 5th and receiving confirmation of no late fees, they received a payment demand.",2023-06-07 14:35:53
1,Negative,Probably the single most brazen display of rogers contempt for their customer. Wanna pay your bill? To bad we've spent every penny of your over priced cell plan on making the worst user experience possible. Logging in on the app? LOL no it opens a browser link because rogers has decided to go backwards in their app design Saving your log in? Absolutely not! You might actually be able to pay your bills on time and see your data usage! Terrible app by a terrible service provider,"Customer expresses extreme frustration with the Rogers app, particularly regarding bill payment functionality and login issues. The app redirects to browser for login instead of handling it in-app, doesn't save login credentials, and makes basic account management difficult. User views these issues as intentionally poor design.",2023-03-10 08:58:18
1,Negative,"Anna the computer chat can not answer any useful information that you need to know.

1,Negative,This app was a good thing. Now they have taken away most of the self service options. They have taken away how we used to be able to see the service in our area for any outages or to report outages. Now they send you to a web browser to talk to Anna the AI. Anna is something so ridiculous that never help. I always have to end up talking to a service rep for something simple. Something I use to be able to fix with the app self serve options in tec support section of the app.,"User complains about Rogers app removing key self-service features, particularly outage reporting and service status checking.

1,Negative,"Second time I'm giving a 1 star rating to this garbage app. You guys are bad in an incredible way. I'm trying to contact support for a misleading bill, and it keeps asking me to sign-in with your Anna bot(dumb and unflexible), in which case I'm already signed-in via the app. The sign-in button does not work. And please, stop replying me to try the ""latest fix"", I have the most up to date app and it's not functioning for basic stuffs. Crazy bad work.","Customer is extremely frustrated with the Rogers app's authentication issues when trying to contact support about a billing concern.

1,Negative,"I would give this app zero stars, if it were possible. I am receiving a message that no network is available, and I cannot call Rogers because my phone cannot connect to the network. So through this app I attempted to access support, yet went through the same circle of questions with the robot.

1,Negative,"Most useless app of the year! Just got off the Rogers chat with Samantha, who was trying to tell me that their app works. Clearly from the comments here I can see I am not the only one experiencing these payment issues. I was told I can pay by phone or by bank or other apps. The thing is, their website and Anna, their AI option don't work either. I ask Samantha, why would I download an app that is of no use to me? It's not 1994, I don't pay my bills by phone. Why does my bill keep going up?","Customer is extremely frustrated with Rogers app's payment functionality not working.

3,Negative,"My experience with app is not user friendly. I thought that if i tried to change my password it may have been an easy fix, ha wrong. It took me to the home screen where i saw no reset but only data plan upsells. I'm so sick of this web page and their shannanigins(i hope it was spelled correctly). I'd better get a credit or something when i call and that's all i can say.","Customer expresses frustration with the Rogers app's poor user experience, specifically regarding password reset functionality.

I literally just paid my phone bill last week I think, and my balance is 0 so I don’t understand why this happened to me. It was stressful and frustrating.
