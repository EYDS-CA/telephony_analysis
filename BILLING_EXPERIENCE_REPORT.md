## Sample User Feedback

### Rogers Billing Failures

> "Update: still crashes (same issue 'MyRogers keeps stopping') App crashes everytime i open it when connected to wifi"

### Bell Billing Failures

### Positive Experiences (Rare)
**Rogers**: "Simple, easy and painless"
**Bell**: "Very simple to use and easier paying on the app then my bank"

## Critical Insights

### 1. Core Functionality Failure
- **26% of all reviews mention billing**
- **~60% negative sentiment for both providers**
- Users cannot reliably complete the primary app function

### 2. Trust Erosion
- Failed auto-payments damage customer relationships
- Unexplained errors create payment anxiety
- Users resort to calling or visiting stores

### 3. Technical Instability
- Both apps crash frequently during payments
- Session management is fundamentally broken
- Loading issues prevent bill access

### 4. Neither Provider Excels
- Bell's marginal advantage (2.53 vs 2.47) is negligible
- Both fail to meet basic user expectations
- Industry-wide problem, not provider-specific

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes (Both Providers)
1. **Fix session timeout issues** - Extend timeout during active input
2. **Improve error messages** - Specific, actionable guidance
3. **Add payment confirmation** - Clear success/failure status

### Short-term Improvements
1. **Simplify payment flow** - Reduce steps and screens
2. **Enable biometric authentication** - For payment authorization
3. **Add retry mechanisms** - Auto-recover from failures

### Long-term Strategy
1. **Rebuild payment infrastructure** - Current systems are fundamentally flawed
2. **Implement proper testing** - Payment flows need extensive QA
3. **Add offline bill viewing** - Reduce data usage concerns

## Industry Comparison

### Banking App Standards
- Banking apps achieve 4.5+ ratings for bill payment
- Biometric authentication is standard
- Payment success rates exceed 95%

### Telecom Reality
- Both providers achieve ~2.5 ratings
- No biometric support for payments
- Success rates below 40%

**Gap Analysis**: Telecom apps are 2+ generations behind banking apps

## Conclusion

Billing functionality represents the greatest failure point in both Rogers and Bell mobile apps. With 1 in 4 users discussing billing and nearly 60% expressing frustration, this core feature actively drives customers away from digital channels. The similar poor performance across both providers suggests systemic industry issues rather than company-specific problems.

**Bottom Line**: In the battle of broken billing, both providers lose equally. Users wanting to pay their bills face a 60% chance of frustration regardless of provider.
