FRUSTRATION,I received my bill for Bell services online. I was shocked to notice that I owed. over $1100. When I checked my payment on my credit card bill. I saw that it was a valid charge as I had not paid for a couple of months. I was still concerned with the method with which it had been allowed to add up. As I had been in the hospital much of the time.. I am merely wanted to discuss this with a service representative and was looking for a phone number..

Repair service,I have had no internet service for 3 days shy of one.  I called on the 22nd of March to report that my internet was  o working. They made an appointment for Sunday 30 March. They called me the 30 and because we had no hydro they canceled the appointment. Another appointment was set for the 30 March and they canceled and said they would have the technician attend the 31st. They didn’t show up or call. However they did notify me my bill hadn’t been paid yet. They missed another appointment after that and showed up on April 4th and the technician went to the pole to work on something completely unrelated to my satellite internet service. He left without even coming in the house to check my modem and dish on the roof. Today is the 15 th of April and I have an appointment for this morning. I’m not having any luck with getting my internet restored. It’s been nearly a month since I’ve been able to watch any of the subscriptions I pay for.

The reason why  was this morning I on April 4 paid $150 to you bell it takes 2 to 3 days to show up in your account but you had one of your employees phone me at 9:30 in the morning but can’t wait till the next day because I did send the payment plus you record everything she wanted me to give $100 or $50 by the 21st of April but I don’t have the money till 26 April you changed the amount of money and I can’t change the date even if I’m paying five dollars right now and there’s 150 coming do better be where the customers that keep you afloat and why that’s why I rated you guys zero I’ve had no problems till now trust me try any of your recordings that you have that woman that I talk to from bell  is her way or the highway that’s not customer service and I’ve never had that happen. You recorded her and recorded me. And I was nice because she was not getting her way. She ended the conversation because it’s being more fair to your company to change the amount. But I know I have the money coming and to catch up on them whole bill. I can’t do that till 26 April. How do you justify that as a Canadian company? Why is it your way or no way?

Glitchy / Annoying,"It’s a 50/50 chance the app just won’t recognize you have an account in general, then the app will freeze or lag. Ever wanted to get your account transferred? With bell you’ll have to take a good 2-3 hours of your day calling 5-6 different phone numbers ALL FOR BELL for each employee to tell you on the phone “that’s not my department here’s a phone number you’re looking for!”. You’re going to be sent running in circles if you reach out for help, they’ll end up with the usual “use our app! It’s super easy!” Even though this app has the worst navigation.

It’s so hard to navigate and when you finally find what you are looking for it might not even be correct. It does not update anything correctly and often sends you the wrong info. It does not update your address or any personal info when you enter it, you sometimes get the wrong bills that are often a year old and customer service keeps trying to push you to use the app when you call them.

Too expensive..,I’m went to vacation abroad in end of december until beginning of february. i bought an esim in that country which i used abroad but bell charged me more than 200 $ in December and more than 180$ in January when i didn’t use anything from bell abroad.

"You can with my Bell, Access, accessibility improvements and more","The application performs the necessary functions unfortunately navigation can be a little confusing if you have a little bit of eyesight.

The ability to hide the keyboard or press OK on making a payment utilizing a verified source and code can be a little challenging, however, the application functions adequately enough to complete my transactions I wish device verification allowed a person using biometrics to sign in and redeem all feature sets of their profile without having to sign in again.
Moderate improvement to accessibility would go a long way on the main page.

The request to sign in again is not required in the beginning, however, when navigating through store options or advanced account options, you may be requested to sign in again. Thanks for the efforts made thus far to improve upon accessibility. It makes it manageable for all to review and manage services With improved independence.

Quick note in addition to the above mentioned, accessibility concerns greater contrast, control, and options between light and dark may also be welcome features.

Bill confusion,"Hi there, I just wanted to make a note to say that I find your billing system super confusing. Reading down from the top of the bill it says that the bill is December 25 and the amount due is $51.52. That makes me think that I am late for last month bill but then it says previous bill paid. After that, it states the amount for January giving the amount plus taxes. When you go to the next screen, it says amount due zero dollars. It’s difficult to understand whether I do owe something or I don’t owe something. I paid anyways and I’m never sure whether I’m up a month or late a month… Surely the amount due could be carried onto the next page instead of saying zero dollars?

Also, I’ll get a thank you in my email and then after the thank you I’ll get a request to pay my bill… Overall, the situation is very confusing. It would be amazing if you could make the information more clear. I showed this to my partner and he agreed that it was confusing, so not just me.

One of the worst apps and worst providers ever,Most of the time does not load bills and payments history. It’s messed up big time. Rogers needs to improve this. Plus I keep getting missed payments but there is an automatic payment setup with my credit card and every month app takes the payment on time. Still I get miss payments every single month. This is why my credit score is getting low and low every single month. I did call at least 7 times in the past 4 months about this matter and they just seem to can’t find out why I am getting that miss payment. And they don’t care about their customers at all. I am gonna call them again and try to fix this issue. If they can’t fix this issue then I will have no choice but to cancel Rogers from my life and will make sure nobody uses Rogers from entire family.,1,Ifty69,6.23.0,2025-05-17 01:00:45,Rogers,iOS,itunes_rss,2025-05-29,0,0,fe7b2fd584bc3bdc2b779b56d260b405

Worst service ever,"I have zero service no matter where I go.  I had to buy a WIFI boaster for my 1900 sqft home or sit on my stairs to get service. I have zero data when I head north, I’m down to nothing after Beaverton, my husband has full service with bell.
I recently cancelled my home phone and my TV, they cancelled my home phone (48.00) but just billed me for my TV that my boxes have been out of commission since Dec.  plus the representative told me they didn’t want my boxes back because they were obsolete, so I could keep them or take them to a land fill. Then I got an email demanding I send them back.
I so dislike wasting my precious time calling this company and knowing what ever I ask will just cause me more issues.
Maybe if they invested their money in true customer service and towers to give their clients top notch service would be more effective then buying sports /concert centers and giving out  a million dollars as price money we may be impressed paying out huge dollars for the most unreliable service",1,alizavetta,6.23.0,2025-05-12 20:40:57,Rogers,iOS,itunes_rss,2025-05-29,0,0,4b80518f32082d2fc51cecc500fcf153

Survey,"To :- Rogers Customer Experience Team ...What is the purpose of asking a customer to complete a survey & not answering the concerns or doing anything about it, I’m perplexed & very frustrated, I’ve been trying for a couple of months to get a few problems fixed.

Obviously I typed the previous message some time ago & thought when I talked to someone in billing that I had all my problems fixed now tonight (Feb.4th) I find I can’t watch the Oilers game, because it’s not showing on my Sportsnet channels.
Please, please, please for the sake of my mental health, before I lose my mind completely can somebody give me ALL Sportsnet channels.
To :- whoever reads this complaint, if there is such a thing as a file on my account you could find that I’ve been phoning & chatting online for months, every time I believe my concerns have been addressed something else crops up, if I thought for 1 minute that Telus would be any easier I would be cancelling my account with Rogers/Shaw immediately.

Terrible app,"This app is absolutely trash. First off it always asks me if I’d like to allow the app to track my location or something to improve my data quality, and I always try to say yes because I’d love to have better data quality but the app does nothing when I tap the yes button or anywhere else it only works when I decline to allow them to track. It’s almost as if they’re just saying this to look good but can’t actually do it or won’t. Secondly why does the app log me out of my account every time if I’m haven’t opened it within the past week or so? Like I used to have bell before and I never had that problem why does the rogers app have it? Overall this app feels like it was built in 2006 it performs terrible loads insanely slow. Right now as I write this I’m trying to get access to my account through the app and I’m stuck at an infinite loading screen just to sign back in because the app logged me out.

Customer for over 20 years,"After a recent payment arrangement, I found out that Rogers does not honour accepted the payment arrangement. I kept my end of the bargain with the payment arrangement. But within those two days, Roger sent me another text message stating that my service disrupted within 24 hours, my service was disconnected in three hours given the 24 hours to pay the bill on top of it Rogers has charged me $70 for the first text message of discontinuing my data after the payment arrangement and a day later, they sent me the text stating I was losing service. Both allowing me 24 hours to do a payment within three hours of both those I was cut off. I now realized on my Rogers account that there is a limit I have and they are 75% into my allotted limit. My bill is $300 a month and the allotted amount they give me this just happened this month. I can tell you I bought numerous phones from without a down payment and this week, I’ve come to learn that if I need a new phone it’s going to percent down? After 20 years of paying this phone bill this is how I get treated from this time buy a phone again from Rogers. I will get my phone from a hawk shop. I will buy it do everything I have to do but buy it from Rogers the only thing Roger is a pay-as-you-go card. I have six months left to go on the new contract with an iPhone 15 Pro funny how things change in six months!

I have to switch to another provider after LESS than 10 hours with Rogers!,"Nov 30,2024 On the phone for about 2.5 hours and spoke to Rogers agent from retention department to switch over my Fido line to Rogers and two of my existing Rogers lines used by my children with a better data, call and text plan. Dec 2, 2024 pm Picked up my new SIM card. from a Rogers store with store personnel said my plan does not include data but i said the retention agent has agreed the plan that include data for me and two other lines. New SIM inserted and no data at this point. I thought it will take few hours for the system to reflect Still no data at around 18:30.Then called and spoke to this rogers agent who is a porting specialist whose duties include retention, she said my plan only talk and text. She then found the chat history on Nov 30 between me and the retention agent about the plan that includes data and US roaming for 3 months. However, she insisted after confirming with her duty manager that there is no such plan exist She offered me the minimum $50 plan, of which, I can get it from my Rogers app, it is worst than the Mobile Shop's Rogers deal and deal of few other stores with one offering $35 for 100GB. I mentioned, TWICE, to her regarding to check with the agent I spoke to on Nov 30 and if the agreed plan confirmed to be of inexistence, please discuss with her manager to provide me a solution. Both times, the best they can do is the $50 plan was her response. She helped to have my children's line reverted to the original plan She could help me to switch back to Fido but a credit check would be required because it will be a totally new Fido account. I left Fido two days ago to their parent company with plan their retention agent offered and accepted, it is their fault and going back to Fido need to do a credit check of which I cannot accept even though it could be just a light credit check. Shortly after hung up, I have to rush to a nearby shopping mall with 45 mins remaining before mall closes to find a new provider because I need data when i am working. I am totally disappointed with Rogers. Sadly, I still have home internet up for renewal in months to come, Rogers credit card and my wife is using Rogers too. Rogers has grown too huge to really care about customer's suffering due to their fault. Now I see why some opposed to Rogers and Shaw merger. I heard many issues with other providers too but i think it is healthy to let their competitors grow stronger. Hopefully, i do not have to consider Rogers again. If other provider is offering you a better deal than Rogers, just take it, DO NOT bother to call Rogers.",1,danny tyy,6.19.0,2024-12-04 14:01:26,Rogers,iOS,itunes_rss,2025-05-29,0,0,e2354bd793dba4fa864243497f97c229

Why is it that people are fast to complain and when their issues are resolved, don’t go back to explain that the issue has been resolved and if it was to their satisfaction?

I have to say that Rogers’s app has always worked fine for me and I am quite satisfied with its performance.

There will always be issues that are not related to the app and human intervention is required!

Pickup this good invention called THE PHONE, and call, stop texting, emailing, etc. And trust the good old phone and a human being behind to help you solve your problem.

Rogers charge unauthorized premium charges for Netflix,I thought I might leave this comment before leaving Rogers. I was a customer for more than 3 years. Looks like every other Rogers user has this fraudulent Netflix charges on their bills like I do. Even I contact Netflix customer care regarding the issue as per the suggestion from the Rogers customer care officer. Netflix is not getting any of these charges and they charge me for a pre authorized amount of 5.99$ + taxes / month from my bank account for the basic Netflix subscription . For the same service Rogers charge me 20.99$ + taxes /month mentioning premium charges for but telling me that this's what Netflix charges putting Netflix into blame. Rogers customer care says someone else from my household is using Netflix premium using another account. So the same lie goes around with everyone telling that there's another Netflix account using another email from my household but that is not even visible to Rogers.hahaa hilarious . Also if somebody else hacked into my internet and hacked my Netflix means Rogers is not a safe internet provider anymore. Also they won't reverse any payments or they won't stop adding these hidden charges. Right now I'm paying 5.99$+ taxes for actual Netflix service and 20.99$+ taxes for Rogers Netflix service . Means I'm paying 26.98$+ taxes per month for a basic netflix subscription but named as premium by the Rogers. This's fradulent and I'll keep posting on social media and make people aware of this. The Rogers manager just left the chat without giving me a proper solution to this matter. And Rogers won't send the chat transcript because they know they cannot cover up this fraud if they sent the chat transcript .,1,I.

Honest review hopefully..,"App is truly great, the only reason why I went with 4 instead of 5 stars was to leave some kind of room for improvement if at all possible. The more clarity in maneuverability around apps I find the better, which is why it’s such an easy way to give a high rating for this app :) hopefully this was motivating in some kind of a way. Everything is clearly visible which was what I meant but if there are functions that your company is finding are not being used as much or at all then the only suggestion I would have would be to remove them in order to create more “space” essentially.

This is the worst support service I have ever received in Canada by far.

At the end the user ID I am using is my email and when I use it to login the app gives me error message that it cannot recognize the user id, then if try to register from scratch and use the same email it tells me this user id is already registered.

Each time I open the app it prompts me with a notification saying “ sorry you are logged out” and then opens a webpage to signing in and go back to the app. Is it possible to remove the “sorry” prompt message and makes signing in more cohesive.
