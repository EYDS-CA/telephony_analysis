   - 6.1% of complaints
   - Secondary concern after core functions

4. **User Experience** (Design, navigation)
   - Only 33.7% negative
   - Least important in hierarchy

### 4. Rogers vs Bell Reality
- **Both fail equally** at edge cases (60% negative sentiment)

   - Proactive failure prevention
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Continuous improvement

## The Business Case

### The Business Case
