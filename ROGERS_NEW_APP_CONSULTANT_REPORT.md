## The Telecom App Hierarchy of Needs

Our analysis reveals that telecom app users prioritize needs in this order:

1. **Core Function Reliability** - Apps that work consistently
2. **Human Support Access** - Easy escalation when technology fails
3. **Performance** - Speed and stability
4. **User Experience** - Design and navigation aesthetics

**Critical Insight**: Bell's superior design provides no advantage when core functions fail. Users forgive ugly interfaces that work; they abandon beautiful interfaces that fail.

## Conclusion

The data is unambiguous: Rogers has a significant opportunity to leapfrog Bell by focusing on functional reliability rather than aesthetic improvements. Current telecom apps fail catastrophically at their core purpose, creating a massive competitive opening.

**The winning strategy is simple**: Build a banking app that pays telecom bills, not a telecom app that tries to look pretty.

**Success requires**: Treating 95%+ success rates for core functions as non-negotiable requirements, not aspirational goals. Users will forgive an ugly app that works; they will abandon a beautiful app that fails.

**Investment Priority**: Technical reliability infrastructure over user interface design. The data shows that even Bell's superior design provides zero competitive advantage when core functions fail.

Rogers can achieve market leadership by becoming the first telecom provider to deliver banking-app reliability for basic customer needs.
