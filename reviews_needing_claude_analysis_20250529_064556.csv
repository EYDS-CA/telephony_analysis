0430af847c5521fa932aa5200e7c2268,Rogers,"Rogers, Bell, Telus; a closed triopoly, not interested in a free market, but only keeping Canadians hostage to their profit goals. 
Their prices (and profits) are kept high by keeping competition out. There is no proactive action taken to work towards securing better deals for clients… and there’s two other paths to take, which are different sides of the same triangle of corporate greed. They lobby really, really hard, under the guise of protecting Canadian interests, when their concern is only self serving.
Open up the communication market and see how well these three succeed in the face of fair competition.",2024-06-29 21:05:19
