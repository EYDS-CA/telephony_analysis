Executive Summary

The Telecom App Hierarchy of Needs
Our analysis reveals a clear hierarchy:

95.1% negative for Technical Issues and 81.5% negative for Billing show that core function reliability matters most.

Apps average 2.58/5 overall (Rogers 2.60, Bell 2.53)‚Äîboth struggle with the same core issues.

The winning formula: Build a "banking app that pays telecom bills" with bulletproof reliability.

Platform Performance Gap
iOS users experience moderately worse app performance than Android users, with 75.4% negative reviews on iOS versus 59.2% on Android.

This 16.2-point gap suggests platform-specific technical issues that affect iOS users more than Android users, who often represent premium customer segments.

CCTS Prevention Opportunity
42.4% of CCTS complaints are billing-related, while our data shows 81.5% negative sentiment in billing category reviews.

Additionally, 72.9% of payment-related mentions are negative (418 positive out of 2,139 mentions).

Fixing these app issues could prevent thousands of regulatory complaints.

Analysis Impact
From 30,000+ app store reviews, we analyzed 10,103 in detail using AI to categorize issues.

This revealed that frustrated users who write reviews experience high failure rates with 72.9% negative payment experiences and 81.5% negative billing sentiment.

These breaking points directly correlate with CCTS data showing 42.4% of formal complaints are billing-related‚Äîproving that fixing app billing functions could prevent thousands of regulatory escalations worth $2,500-6,500 each¬≤.

Bell's Smart CX Decisions: Evidence from App Design
Visual analysis confirms Bell's strategic advantages:

1) Hidden complexity - Chat requires 3 taps but delivers humans immediately (vs Rogers' instant chat that deflects).

2) Priority hierarchy - Core functions (usage/billing) above promotions (vs Rogers' credit card ads competing with bill payment).

3) Payment transparency - Shows current payment method before asking for alternatives (vs Rogers' confusing credit-first approach).

Despite similar app store ratings, written reviews average 2.58/5, and Bell has 2x fewer chatbot-related complaints (407 vs 822 negative mentions).
