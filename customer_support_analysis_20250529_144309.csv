Obviously I typed the previous message some time ago & thought when I talked to someone in billing that I had all my problems fixed now tonight (Feb.4th) I find I can‚Äôt watch the Oilers game, because it‚Äôs not showing on my Sportsnet channels.
Please, please, please for the sake of my mental health, before I lose my mind completely can somebody give me ALL Sportsnet channels.
To :- whoever reads this complaint, if there is such a thing as a file on my account you could find that I‚Äôve been phoning & chatting online for months, every time I believe my concerns have been addressed something else crops up, if I thought for 1 minute that Telus would be any easier I would be cancelling my account with Rogers/Shaw immediately.

Dec 2, 2024 pm Picked up my new SIM card. from a Rogers store with store personnel said my plan does not include data but i said the retention agent has agreed the plan that include data for me and two other lines. New SIM inserted and no data at this point. I thought it will take few hours for the system to reflect Still no data at around 18:30.Then called and spoke to this rogers agent who is a porting specialist whose duties include retention, she said my plan only talk and text. She then found the chat history on Nov 30 between me and the retention agent about the plan that includes data and US roaming for 3 months. However, she insisted after confirming with her duty manager that there is no such plan exist She offered me the minimum $50 plan, of which, I can get it from my Rogers app, it is worst than the Mobile Shop's Rogers deal and deal of few other stores with one offering $35 for 100GB. I mentioned, TWICE, to her regarding to check with the agent I spoke to on Nov 30 and if the agreed plan confirmed to be of inexistence, please discuss with her manager to provide me a solution. Both times, the best they can do is the $50 plan was her response. She helped to have my children's line reverted to the original plan She could help me to switch back to Fido but a credit check would be required because it will be a totally new Fido account. I left Fido two days ago to their parent company with plan their retention agent offered and accepted, it is their fault and going back to Fido need to do a credit check of which I cannot accept even though it could be just a light credit check. Shortly after hung up, I have to rush to a nearby shopping mall with 45 mins remaining before mall closes to find a new provider because I need data when i am working. I am totally disappointed with Rogers. Sadly, I still have home internet up for renewal in months to come, Rogers credit card and my wife is using Rogers too. Rogers has grown too huge to really care about customer's suffering due to their fault. Now I see why some opposed to Rogers and Shaw merger. I heard many issues with other providers too but i think it is healthy to let their competitors grow stronger. Hopefully, i do not have to consider Rogers again. If other provider is offering you a better deal than Rogers, just take it, DO NOT bother to call Rogers.",Customer Support,Billing

Looks like every other Rogers user has this fraudulent Netflix charges on their bills like I do. Even I contact Netflix customer care regarding the issue as per the suggestion from the Rogers customer care officer. Netflix is not getting any of these charges and they charge me for a pre authorized amount of 5.99$ + taxes / month from my bank account for the basic Netflix subscription . For the same service Rogers charge me 20.99$ + taxes /month mentioning premium charges for but telling me that this's what Netflix charges putting Netflix into blame. Rogers customer care says someone else from my household is using Netflix premium using another account. So the same lie goes around with everyone telling that there's another Netflix account using another email from my household but that is not even visible to Rogers.hahaa hilarious . Also if somebody else hacked into my internet and hacked my Netflix means Rogers is not a safe internet provider anymore. Also they won't reverse any payments or they won't stop adding these hidden charges. Right now I'm paying 5.99$+ taxes for actual Netflix service and 20.99$+ taxes for Rogers Netflix service . Means I'm paying 26.98$+ taxes per month for a basic netflix subscription but named as premium by the Rogers. This's fradulent and I'll keep posting on social media and make people aware of this. The Rogers manager just left the chat without giving me a proper solution to this matter. And Rogers won't send the chat transcript because they know they cannot cover up this fraud if they sent the chat transcript .,Customer Support,Billing

I was informed by Tech support (after almost 3 weeks of not having my data usage availability issue solved) that to get my data usage, i have to use the website account which is definitely a step backwards regarding convenience. This is contrary to what i was informed when switched from the previous app for which i had no issues accessing my data usage. If that's the case then why was the previous app discontinued since i could access the data usage through that. If this app does not fully support small business users then that should clearly be stated. The phone and plan tabs populate correctly, but the usage tab says i have made a plan change (which i have never made) and so usage details are unavailable.",Customer Support,Authentication
