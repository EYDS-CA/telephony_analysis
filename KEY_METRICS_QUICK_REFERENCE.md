## Key Derivation Examples

### How we got 60% negative sentiment:
```
Negative reviews: 7,669
Total reviews: 12,785
Calculation: 7,669 √∑ 12,785 = 0.5996 = 60.0%
95% CI: ¬±0.8% (using standard error formula)
```

### How we got 7.7% login success:
```
Reviews mentioning login: 1,290
Positive login reviews: 99
Calculation: 99 √∑ 1,290 = 0.0767 = 7.7%
Note: This is NOT 7.7% of all users, just of those who mentioned login
```

### How we got 0.06% review rate:
```
Rogers claimed rate: 0.079% (unverified)
Bell claimed rate: 0.037% (unverified)
Average: (0.079 + 0.037) √∑ 2 = 0.058 ‚âà 0.06%
