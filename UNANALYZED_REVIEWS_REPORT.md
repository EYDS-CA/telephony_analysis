   - More potential complaints (89 unanalyzed)
   - 11,293 reviews awaiting analysis

3. **Coverage Goals**:
   - Short-term: Achieve 50% coverage for Bell (analyze ~3,721 more reviews)
   - Medium-term: Achieve 80% coverage for both providers
   - Long-term: Analyze all 16,764 remaining reviews

4. **Quality Considerations**: The unanalyzed reviews include:
   - 45.3% negative (1-star) reviews
   - Reviews from 2010-2025 timeframe
   - Predominantly Android platform reviews

## Output File

All 16,764 unanalyzed reviews have been saved to `telecom_app_reviews_unanalyzed.csv` for future processing.

## Impact on Current Analysis

Current dashboard insights may be skewed because:
- Bell is underrepresented (only 25% analyzed vs 62% for Rogers)
- 112 potential complaints are not included in complaint rates
- The true Bell complaint rate might be higher than currently shown (2.2%)

Analyzing the remaining reviews would provide a more complete and accurate picture of both providers' performance.
