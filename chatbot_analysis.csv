Rogers,1,Negative,"You can't contact Roger's. If you call them, they will give a message saying they will call you back. They never call you back.

Rogers,2,Negative,"For general billing or basic info its great, but anything more its not at all. Will ask you to download other apps, like rogers x, that don't work, but are required.

The chat support wanted me to check app versions.. etc. Already tried my manufacturer.. no help. Contacted Rogers chat and never had SIM checked. The best part about the app is if you complain in the community forum, or rate the app, they do fix mistakes. Thank you! Works now!","The customer had an issue with their SIM card after changing their phone number, and the chat support was not helpful in resolving the problem. However, the customer found that complaining in the community forum or rating the app helped get the issue resolved.",Technical Issues

And even when you asked and confirmed specifically for the pay per use plan while abroad, the moment you send a text or make a call your plan is forced to be changed into $15/day roam like home plan, without your consent or awareness.

Rogers,1,Negative,This app was a good thing. Now they have taken away most of the self service options.

Bell,5,Positive,"Man some people are salty! Blaming a company for being horrible because their app doesn't work for you. The app works GREAT on my LG G4, has worked great in the past with my G3 and my iPhone 5. I've never had any issues with Self Serve or My Bell, so I don't know where these complaints are coming from. Or maybe people just wanna complain for the sake of complaining.","The app works great for the user on their LG G4 and past devices, and they do not understand the complaints about the app not working.",Performance
Rogers,3,Negative,The ‚ÄúPay with the Rogers Bank credit card‚Äù popup in the billing menu doesn‚Äôt go away after I set my card to the Rogers card. The AI support chatbot is also completely worthless and there‚Äôs no way to send a simple bug report.,"The app has issues with the billing menu popup and the AI chatbot, and there is no way to report bugs.",Billing
Rogers,1,Negative,Not helpful at all late replies and leave the chat without informing,"The review criticizes the app's customer support, citing late replies and abrupt disconnections from chat support.",Customer Support
Rogers,5,Positive,"No matter what anyone says, Rogers is always my first and foremost preference if they offer the service. Even in deep forests and some deep winter locations, I have at least 1 bar signal to call someone. I had a secondary sim with Telus and it sucks. This app is super easy to use and manage. A couple of things to modify on this app are to have no session timeout and live chat on the app itself.","The user is very satisfied with the Rogers app and network coverage, but suggests a couple of improvements like no session timeout and live chat within the app.",Network Issues
Rogers,5,Negative,"For first time my phone stopped working only had sos service. Then I was trying to talk with an agent but they Anna chat thing almost cut off my service and then I got a message saying to shut the phone off and on to restart my phone.
I literally just paid my phone bill last week I think, and my balance is 0 so I don‚Äôt understand why this happened to me. It was stressful and frustrating. Also why did the Anna chat thing almost cut off my service when I was trying to talk to an agent. That‚Äôs not fair and it doesn‚Äôt make sense. I still don‚Äôt know how to speak to a live person. I tried calling 611 and nothing worked.","The user experienced issues with their phone service, including losing service and having trouble contacting a live agent, which was frustrating and stressful.",Technical Issues
Rogers,1,Negative,"Came here to say this: in the last week I have been unable to upgrade, change SIM, change plans or really do anything outside of check my bill and my damned usage as a LONG TIME CUSTOMER it‚Äôs almost made me wanna cancel ALL my services, what good is this app if I  HAVE to call or speak to someone to do something I was promised the ability to do on my own?? FIX IT","The user is frustrated with the limited functionality of the Rogers iOS app, which does not allow them to perform basic account management tasks like upgrading, changing SIM, or changing plans without having to call or speak to someone.",Account Management
Rogers,1,Negative,"I started a chat to know how to check how many of the international minutes I have left in my account. After 40 min of wait time, the lady wrote you have to check in your call log. 
Changing my provider within days.","The user had a poor experience trying to check their international minutes balance through the app's chat support, leading them to consider switching providers.",Customer Support
Bell,1,Negative,What was supposed be o be a quick and easy experience turned into hours wasted. When street name and road suffix would get swapped by the app every time I tried to check out with my payment info. I got prompted to an incompetent chat agent. How am I supposed to use this service? Forcing customers to go in store so they can get charged an activation fee.,"The user had a frustrating experience with the Bell app, where the app kept swapping the street name and road suffix when trying to check out with payment info, leading to an incompetent chat agent experience and forcing the user to go in-store to get charged an activation fee.",Billing
